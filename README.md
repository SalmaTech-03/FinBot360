## üöÄ Core Features

This project combines several powerful modules into one seamless user experience:

*   **ü§ñ Natural Language Financial Q&A:** A conversational AI assistant, powered by Google's **Gemini**, that can answer complex questions about market trends, financial concepts, and definitions.
*   **üìà LSTM-Based Stock Forecasting:** A predictive tool that uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to forecast future stock prices based on historical data. The resulting chart is persistent, allowing for comparison and analysis.
*   **üî¥ Real-Time Market Dashboard:** A live sidebar widget that provides:
    *   Real-time stock prices with a robust **fallback system** (tries Alpha Vantage first, then seamlessly switches to Yahoo Finance if the API limit is reached).
    *   A dynamic chart showing the stock's performance over the last month.
*   **üòä Financial Sentiment Analysis:** An NLP tool that uses a specialized **FinBERT** model to analyze the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of financial news, articles, or any text.
*   **üìÅ Portfolio Performance Analysis:** A utility to upload a portfolio's historical data (CSV/XLSX) and instantly calculate key performance metrics like Total Return, Annualized Volatility, and the Sharpe Ratio.
